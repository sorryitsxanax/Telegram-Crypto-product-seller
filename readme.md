Hi, I'm Xan, and I'm selling my Telegram bot.

I'll briefly explain what it does. The customer selects a product in the bot and adds it to the cart.
If they want, they can remove a product or proceed to payment, which will take them to another screen
where they are asked for the delivery address and shown the shipping cost. At the time of payment, a 
local LTC wallet is generated.

Every 6 hours, a job runs to check if the order has been paid (if it has, the status will be set to "PAID"). 
Another job waits for the order to reach the "PAID" status and have a balance; once it does,
the money is sent to the owner's wallet (which is mine).

To see for yourself go to @MOXDOLL_BOT

If you want to talk about prices to buy the bot, send a message to my telegram @Moxdoll
